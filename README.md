# General project's goal
Find correlation within crime data and apply machine learning for prediction

## Data description
We will use the data from the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS).
The NIBRS is an incident-based reporting system used by law enforcement agencies in the United States for collecting and reporting data on crimes. Local, state and federal agencies generate NIBRS data from their records management systems. 
Here is the [link](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/downloads "NIBRS_link") to the downloadable data.

## Notes
I will purposefully exclude race or ethnicity considerations

## Project's steps
- Exploratoy Data Analysis, aiming at:
    - understanding data
    - select the features I want to use (=> further specify project's focus)
    - find specifics and patterns in the data
    - create visualizations using Python
- Clean data using Python
- Apply machine learning
